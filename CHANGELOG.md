## 0.2.0 - 2026-09-03

- feat: `generateNext(ir, { assets })` (`src/codegen/next.js`) emits a runnable
  Next.js App Router project — `app/page.jsx`, `app/layout.jsx`, `app/globals.css`,
  `package.json`, `next.config.mjs`. The component file is byte-for-byte
  `generateReact`'s output, so the two can never drift apart in what they claim
  the design looks like; the rest is scaffolding. A canvas-fit design scales
  itself with `useState`/`useEffect`, so that variant — and only that variant —
  is marked `'use client'`. Fonts go through `@import` in `globals.css`, which is
  the one mechanism that behaves the same in `next dev`, `next build` and a
  copy-paste of the file elsewhere.
- fix: **`generateReact` never received `assets`**, so every image emitted
  `src={""}` and every vector emitted the "asset not exported" dashed outline —
  the React output was structurally correct and completely blank. It now takes
  the same `assets` map as the HTML emitter and follows the same rules: a cropped
  fill becomes a `role="img"` div carrying the background layer, everything else
  becomes an `<img>` with the data URI, and a missing export falls back to the
  same transparent placeholder. On a four-image frame that is the difference
  between 1.7 KB of markup and 5.7 MB of actual page.
- refactor: `fontStylesheetUrls(ir)` split out of `html.js`'s `fontLinks()` and
  exported, so emitters that cannot use a `<link>` tag can reach the same font
  list. `generateHtml` output is byte-identical across the change.

- feat: `figma_verify` now checks **paint order and clipping** alongside the
  pixel diff and the bounding-box IoU (`src/paintOrder.js`). Figma lists children
  back-to-front, so a node's pre-order index is its paint order; the render is
  probed with `elementsFromPoint` over a sample grid and the two orders compared
  wherever elements actually overlap. This closes a real blind spot: an overlay
  given a `z-index` that puts it in front of a card the design stacks it behind
  moves no bounding box, so IoU scores it a perfect match, and on a 1440x10490
  frame it swaps too few pixels to clear the diff threshold — yet it is one of
  the most obvious errors to a human. The same pass reports elements cut off by
  an ancestor's `overflow` where the design lets them overhang, which is what
  leaves a hard seam under a decorative element meant to bridge two sections.
  Findings are surfaced as `WRONG STACKING` / `OVER-CLIPPED` with the Figma paint
  indices, and are reported even when the pixel diff has converged — the headline
  now reads NOT CONVERGED when the layering is wrong. `npm run example:paint-order`
  demonstrates both against a three-element frame.
- fix: paint sampling scrolls the page and uses a square sample pitch, so the
  result no longer depends on viewport height. `elementsFromPoint` is
  viewport-relative: a 1440x10490 frame verified at a 900px viewport was sampled
  only across its first screen, found 13 overlapping pairs instead of 502, and
  reported a clean bill of health for a frame with 24 stacking errors in it —
  silently, since `figma_verify` accepts an explicit `height`. Both viewports now
  return identical findings.
- fix: hit-testing briefly forces `pointer-events: auto` while sampling. Without
  it `elementsFromPoint` skips exactly the decorative overlays this check exists
  to catch, since those routinely carry `pointer-events: none`. It has no layout
  effect and is reverted before the function returns; the screenshot is taken
  first, so the capture never sees it.

## 0.1.0 - 2026-09-01

First release.

- feat: three MCP tools over stdio — `figma_convert` (frame → self-contained HTML
  + IR + assets, deterministic, no LLM), `figma_verify` (render in Chromium,
  pixel-diff against the Figma reference, IoU-check every element box, return
  targeted fix instructions), and `figma_inspect` (IR as a filterable outline).
  Tools return file paths and numbers rather than blobs — a converted frame is
  often 100+ KB of HTML, and pushing that through a tool result would burn the
  agent's context for nothing.
- feat: the refine loop runs through the CALLING agent, not an LLM inside the
  server. No `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, no second model billing, and the agent keeps
  full context on what it already tried. `src/refine/` still offers a headless
  loop for library use.
- feat: Figma responses are cached per frame, so everything after the first
  `figma_convert` runs offline — including while rate-limited, where a stale
  frame still beats no frame.
- fix: the cache and `.figma-token` are now anchored to the directory the server
  is started from, not to the package root, with `FIGMA_MCP_CACHE_DIR` to
  override. Installed via `npx` the package root is a throwaway directory inside
  `node_modules`: a 100 MB frame cache written there is silently lost on the next
  install, and a `.figma-token` there could never be found at all.
- fix: `verifyLoop`'s `onIteration` event now carries `renderPng`. It previously
  exposed only the diff, and a diff of a blank page is indistinguishable from a
  converged one — which is exactly how `example/run-example.js` came to write its
  diff images out under `render-N.png`, making a converged run look like it had
  rendered nothing. Both are now written under their real names.
- chore: `postinstall` no longer fails the install when the Chromium download
  fails or is skipped. `figma_convert` and `figma_inspect` need no browser at
  all, so a CI install or a `PLAYWRIGHT_SKIP_BROWSER_DOWNLOAD=1` install is a
  perfectly reasonable thing to want.
